## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following:

### Apps and Packages

- `client`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `server`: an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server
- `@markly/ui`: a React component library
- `@markly/utils`: Isomorphic utils (a small wrapper around console.log)
- `@markly/eslint-config`: ESLint presets
- `@markly/typescript-config`: tsconfig.json's used throughout the monorepo
- `@markly/jest-presets`: Jest configurations

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Docker

This markly is configured to be built with Docker, and Docker compose. To build all apps in this markly:

```
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create app_network

# Build prod using new BuildKit engine
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build

# Start prod in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

To shutdown all running containers:

```
# Stop running containers started by docker-compse
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

This example includes optional remote caching. In the Dockerfiles of the apps, uncomment the build arguments for `TURBO_TEAM` and `TURBO_TOKEN`. Then, pass these build arguments to your Docker build.

You can test this behavior using a command like:

`docker build -f apps/client/Dockerfile . --build-arg TURBO_TEAM=“your-team-name” --build-arg TURBO_TOKEN=“your-token“ --no-cache`

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
